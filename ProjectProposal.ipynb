    "Our hypothesis is that younger, taller, athletes from America, China, or Russia seem the most likely to earn medals in the Olympics. Younger athletes are in their physical prime and we believe that they are much more likely to perform well versus older athletes. Taller athletes are better for certain sports because their longer arms and legs can give them an advantage in movement. We think that those three countries are most likely to earn medals because they probably contribute more money to ensure that their athletes are trained the best."

The data is also factual and recorded data of the athletes, therefore there are no biases because the data was collected similarly and presented similarly among the participants. "
