Our first step  was to analyze the data and understand what was given and how we can interpret them. Since our data was both  qualitative and quantitative, we split the group up so that ; Mahkameh, Joshua and Hatef were in charge of the qualitative data finding out how that data was  going to help in our research and analysis methods. While Abdul, Rigo , Locarno cleaned and sorted the data to best fit the project needs.\n",

    "Once we were done cleaning and going over our raw data, we then began to set and choose variables we wanted to study. We took our time going over appropriate ways to label, compare and study the variables to perhaps find correlations. We are still in the process of finding correlations and regression and deciding what data is worth presenting and which ones are not worth. We also began the discussion of how we would present our research. Different tables, colors, layouts were discussed as well as appropriate graphs. For the most part we had accomplished a good amount of work. We are in the process of finalizing and reviewing our project, we are hopeful to finish in a timely manner.\n"

Group members workflow steady and work gets done in a timely fashion."
